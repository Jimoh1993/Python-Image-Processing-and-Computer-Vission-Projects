# Python-Image-Processing-and-Computer-Vission-Projects
Today's world is full of data, and images form a significant part of this data. However, before they can be used, these digital images must be processedâ€”analyzed and manipulated in order to improve their quality or extract some information that can be put to use.
Common image processing tasks include displays; basic manipulations like cropping, flipping, rotating, etc.; image segmentation, classification, and feature extractions; image restoration; and image recognition. Python is an excellent choice for these types of image processing tasks due to its growing popularity as a scientific programming language and the free availability of many state-of-the-art image processing tools in its ecosystem.
This projects looks at 10 of the most commonly used Python libraries for image processing and computer vision projects tasks. 
These libraries provide an easy and intuitive way to transform images and make sense of the underlying data.
Status: Implemetation in Progress...
